Here's what we were '



## Interesting findings
Note:
These are associations.  These describe features of the neighborhood. We are not saying its causal.  
The hotter a neighborhood is in the afternoon, the more likely it is:
heat_vs demographics  
--to have a lower percentage of owners (-.65)
--have a lower life expectancy (-.41)
--have a lower median household income (-.24)
--have a higher "walk score" (.67)
--have a higher rate of dirty streets and alleys (.62)
--have higher violent crime rate (.58)
--have higher part 1 serious crime rate (.56)
--have higher property crime rate (.53)
--a higher rate of residents without a car (.51)
--have a higher rate of residents with less than a high school education (.48)
--have a higher percentage of population that walks to work (.48)
--have a higher rate of properties with housing violations (.45)
--have a higher density of liquor stores (.44)
--have a higher rate of vacant properties (.43)
--have a higher rate of vacant properties owned by the city (.43)
--have a higher rate of shootings (.40) and gun homicides (.38) and drug calls (.36)
--have a higher rate of families below poverty line (.4) and rate of households earning less than 25K. (.37) and kids below poverty line (.34) and unemployment rate (.32) and higher infant mortality (.27)
--have a higher teen pregnancy rate (.32)
--have a higer rate of population that uses public transport to get to work (.38)

Trees vs demographics
The lower the percentage of treecover a neighborhood has, the:
--higher percentage of liquor stores it has (-.64)
--the higher violent crime (-.63), part 1 crime (-.59) and property crime (-.56), assault calls (-.50), shootings (-.39) drug calls (-.36), gun homicides (-.35) rate it has. 
--the higher walk score (-.57)
--the higher rate between dirty streets and alleys (-.56)
--the higher the rate of residents who walk to work (-.41)
--the higher percentage of residents receiving tanf (-.38)
--the higher rate of teen pregancies (-.37)
--higher hispanic population (-.33)
--higher percentage of vacant houses (-.36) and vacants owned by the city -.35
--higher properties with housing violations (percentage) (-.32)
--higher percentage of kids below poverty line (-.28)
--higher percentage of families below poverty line (-.35)
--higher rate of public transport to work ()

Tree vs heat
It's hard to get stronger relationships between heat and trees.
Simply put the hottest neighborhoods are also those with the least amount of treecover, no matter how you measure it. 
Relationshiop between median temperature in the morning, evening and afternoon was a near perfect inverse correlation.  Meaning the hottest neighborhoods have the fewest trees and vice versa. This holds true whehter we're using the 50 percent probability and 25 percent.  
for example.  The correlation between temperature median in the afternoon and tree cover was -.86 (25 percent prob) and -.86 for 127 probability. 
The hottest neighborhoods also had the least amount of tree cover growth, whether mesured by percentage point growth or by percentage growth in treecover between 2009 and 2018. Simply put, the coolest neighborhoods are those with the most trees AND the biggest gains in trees over the last decade.  The rich get richer, so to speak. For exmaple, the correlation between median temperature in the morning and percentage point change in treecover between 2009 and 2017 was -.64, and -.73 for percentage point change.  The higher the temperature, the less likely it was to have a smaller gain and a smaller relative gain in treecover over that period. 

Tree vs tree growth.
Simply put the areas with the highest amount of canopy cover in 2009 were those that saw the largest amount of growth by 2017-18.  Measuring at 25 percnet probability, there was an R of .74  between an areas mean canopy cover (63) in 201719 and the percentage point change in tree canopy cover over the preceeding 10 years.  At 127, the percentage point change was .70.
