## Introduction

This R markdown document describes the methodology and results of a portion of the data analysis we conducted in support of a reporting project examining the effects of tree canopy inequity across the city of Baltimore, especially as it relates to climate change.

## Setup

```{r results='hide', echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#######################
#### Load Packages ####
#######################

library(tidyverse)
require(scales) # For percent labeling on distribution tables
library(DescTools) # For %like% operator
library(here) # For cleaner file path writing

# Turn off scientific notation in RStudio (prevents coersion to character type)
options(scipen = 999)

```

## Define Functions

```{r}
# Create a function to convert celcius values to fahrenheit
c_to_f_convert <- function(x) (x * (9/5) + 32)
```
