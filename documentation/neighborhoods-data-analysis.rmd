## Introduction

REWRITE
This R markdown document describes the methodology and results of a portion of the data analysis we conducted in support of a reporting project examining the effects of tree canopy inequity across the city of Baltimore, especially as it relates to climate change.

In general, this document is arranged into analyses of the following categories, though there are some cases where one statistic depends on multiple categories (e.g. the canopy cover in a hot neighborhood):

* Temperature
* Demographics
* Tree Canopy
* Street Trees (individual tree tracking)

## Setup

Before running this file, **please view and run the [Code Red Data Cleaning document](https://github.com/smussenden/2019-baltimore-climate-health-project-data-repo/blob/master/documentation/code-red-data-cleaning.md)** for this project. As well as outputting necessary cleaned data for the following ananlysis, that document also includes the following items necessary to understand this analysis: 

* definitions
* source data citation and information
* cleaning methodology 
* software tools used

Reporters from the University of Maryland’s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and Capital News Service placed sensors that record heat and humidity inside several homes in McElderry Park (BG 8/8/19) and nearby neighborhoods. Those sensors recorded temperatures that reached as high as 97 degrees and heat index values of 119 degrees.

The following arranges and ranks blocks across the city by temperature in the afternoon of August 29, 2018, as explained in the [Code Red Data Cleaning document](https://github.com/smussenden/2019-baltimore-climate-health-project-data-repo/blob/master/documentation/code-red-data-cleaning.md#load-and-clean-temperature-data).

```{r}

blocks_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(geoid10, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  arrange(rank)

```

Below, we see the block on N. Milton Avenue between Oliver and Federal is one of the city's hottest, ranking at 236 out of 13,598 blocks. The block GEOID for this block was pulled from QGIS and breaks down into the following codes:

* State: 24
* County: 510
* Tract: 080301
* Block: 1000

```{r}

blocks_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(geoid10, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  filter(geoid10 == "245100803011000")

```

### Neighborhood Statistical Areas by temperature

The following arranges and ranks NSAs across the city by temperature in the afternoon of August 29, 2018.

First, we can see that all of the top 10 hottest NSAs are located in the south of the city, and many are in the south-east.

```{r}

# Top 10 hottest neighborhoods
nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  slice(1:10)

```

Looking at the 10 coolest NSAs, we see it is generally true that they are located far to the west and north, on the outskirts of Baltimore.

```{r}

# Top 10 coolest neighborhoods
nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  arrange(desc(rank)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

```

Below we see:

* McElderry Park was the hottest, at 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Gwynns Falls/Leakin Park was the coolest, at 90.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

```{r}

nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  filter((temp_mean_aft == min(temp_mean_aft)) | (temp_mean_aft == max(temp_mean_aft))) %>%
  arrange(desc(temp_mean_aft))

```

The difference in temperatures between the city's hottest and coolest neighborhoods is `r round((min(nsa_tree_temp$temp_mean_aft)) - (max(nsa_tree_temp$temp_mean_aft)), 2)` degrees Fahrenheit.

Below, we see the relative ranks of the Broadway East and Roland Park neighborhoods, placing Roland Park at 263 out of 278 neighborhoods, while Roland Park is ranked at 16.

```{r}

nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  filter((nsa_name %like% "roland park") | nsa_name %like% ("broadway east"))

```

These data are visualized in the following choropleth map, which was exported from QGIS and prettified slightly in Illustrator:

## Demographics Analysis

For the demographic anaylsis, we used CSA rather than NSA geographic segments, for reasons explained in the [Code Red Data Cleaning document](https://github.com/smussenden/2019-baltimore-climate-health-project-data-repo/blob/master/documentation/code-red-data-cleaning.md). The CSAs and NSAs do not allign completely. The demographic information is primarily from the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. Further explanations about the source data are in the [Code Red Data Cleaning document](https://github.com/smussenden/2019-baltimore-climate-health-project-data-repo/blob/master/documentation/code-red-data-cleaning.md#load-and-clean-demographic-data).

First, the top 10 CSAs ranked by percent of families living below the poverty line:

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         avg_household_income = median_household_income, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-perc_below_poverty)) %>%
  arrange(rank)

```

Next, we see only the CSAs containing the NSAs mentioned in the story, ranked by percent of families living below the poverty line (out of 55 ranks).

* The **Broadway East** NSA is split vertically down the middle between the **Clifton-Berea** and **Greenmount East** CSAs, which also include large portions of the surrounding NSAs. It also includes an insignificant sliver of Oldtown/Middle East, which was disregarded in this analysis.
* The **McElderry Park** NSA is split horizontally across the middle between **Madison/East End** and **Patterson Park North & East**, both of which contain large portions of surrounding NSAs. 
* The **Roland Park** NSA is almost completely contained within the **Greater Roland Park/Poplar Hill** CSA. A small southern slice extends into the Medfield/Hampden/Woodberry/Remington CSA, but that CSA extends so far south as to be non-representative of most of Roland Park and was disregarded in this analysis.

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line)) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  mutate(associated_nsa = case_when(
    (csa2010 %like% "%clifton%") | (csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%") ~ "broadway east",
    (csa2010 %like% "%madison%") | (csa2010 %like% "%park north%") ~ "mcelderry park",
    (csa2010 %like% "%poplar%") ~ "roland park",
    T ~ NA_character_
  )) %>%
  select(csa2010, associated_nsa, 
         avg_household_income = median_household_income, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line, 
         rank) %>%
  filter((csa2010 %like% "%clifton%") | 
           (csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%madison%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%park north%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%poplar%"))

```

Broadway East, as a combination of Clifton-Berea and Greenmount East, has a total percent of family households living below the poverty line of `r round((csa_tree_temp_demographics$percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line[csa_tree_temp_demographics$csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%"] +
csa_tree_temp_demographics$percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line[csa_tree_temp_demographics$csa2010 %like% "%clifton%"]) / 2, 2)` according to:

```{r}

(csa_tree_temp_demographics$percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line[csa_tree_temp_demographics$csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%"] +
csa_tree_temp_demographics$percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line[csa_tree_temp_demographics$csa2010 %like% "%clifton%"]) / 2

```

## Tree Canopy Analysis

The following tree canopy data is based on LIDAR data from 2015, as explained in the [Code Red Data Cleaning document](https://github.com/smussenden/2019-baltimore-climate-health-project-data-repo/blob/master/documentation/code-red-data-cleaning.md#load-and-clean-tree-canopy-lidar-data). 

### Poverty compared to tree canopy

A correlation matrix of poverty and canopy cover shows a weak negative correlation of -.34. In other words, places with a high poverty rate will have fewer trees, in general.

``` {r}

#### Build correlation matrix ####
csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  correlate() %>%
  mutate(variable=rowname) %>%
  select(variable, everything(), -rowname)

```

Here are the data related to poverty, income and canopy at the top and bottom five CSAs when ranked for poverty:

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         avg_household_income = median_household_income, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  mutate(rank_poverty = rank(-perc_below_poverty),
         rank_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015)) %>%
  filter(between(rank_poverty, 1L, 5L) |
           between(rank_poverty, 51L, 55L)) %>%
  arrange(rank_poverty)

```

Looking again at only the NSAs of interest in the story:

```{r, columns.print=7}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  mutate(rank_perc_poverty = rank(-percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line),
         rank_perc_canopy = rank(-`15_lid_mean`)) %>%
  arrange(rank_perc_canopy) %>%
  mutate(associated_nsa = case_when(
    (csa2010 %like% "%clifton%") | (csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%") ~ "broadway east",
    (csa2010 %like% "%madison%") | (csa2010 %like% "%park north%") ~ "mcelderry park",
    (csa2010 %like% "%poplar%") ~ "roland park",
    T ~ NA_character_
  )) %>%
  select(csa2010, associated_nsa, 
         avg_household_income = median_household_income, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line, 
         perc_canopy = `15_lid_mean`,
         rank_perc_poverty,
         rank_perc_canopy) %>%
  filter((csa2010 %like% "%clifton%") | 
           (csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%madison%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%park north%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%poplar%"))

```

If we build a correlation matrix only looking at certain neighborhoods of interest, the pattern is even more pronounced:

``` {r}

#### Build correlation matrix ####
csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  filter(csa2010 %in% target_csas) %>%
  select(perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  correlate() %>%
  mutate(variable=rowname) %>%
  select(variable, everything(), -rowname)

```

Below is the trend viewed graphically:

``` {r}

# CSAs to call out
callout_ls <- c("Canton", "Clifton-Berea", "Greater Roland Park/Poplar Hill", "Greenmount East")

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%

    y = `07_lid_mean`
    )) +

                              filter(csa2010 %in% callout_ls) %>%
                              mutate(csa2010 = case_when(
                                csa2010 == "Greenmount East" ~ "Greenmount East \n(includes part of Broadway East)",

                                T ~ csa2010)),
            aes(label = csa2010),
            min.segment.length = .1,
            segment.alpha = .5,
            alpha = .85,
            nudge_x = .05,
            nudge_y = .06) +
  # This section for labeling Patterson Park (so its label can be nudged)
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(data = csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
                              mutate_at(vars("csa2010"), str_to_title) %>%
                              filter(csa2010 == "Patterson Park North & East") %>%

                                csa2010 == "Patterson Park North & East" ~ "Patterson Park North & East \n(includes most of McElderry Park)",
                                T ~ csa2010)),
                            aes(label = csa2010),
                            min.segment.length = .1,
                            segment.alpha = .5,
                            alpha = .85,
                            nudge_x = -.06,

```

There are some exceptions to this trend, such as Penn North/Reservoir Hill and Greater Rosemont, which both have relatively high rates of both poverty and tree canopy:

``` {r, columns.print=5}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  mutate(rank_perc_poverty = rank(-perc_below_poverty),
         rank_perc_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015)) %>%
  arrange(rank_perc_canopy) %>%
  filter((csa2010 %like% "%penn north%") | (csa2010 %like% "%rosemont%"))

```

Average canopy cover by NSA is visualized in the following choropleth map, which was exported from QGIS and prettified slightly in Illustrator:

<img src="../documentation/choropleth-canopy-full-withlines-01.png" width="400" alt="Choropleth map of temperatures across Baltimore NSAs" />

### Temperature compared to tree canopy

When comparing temperature to tree canopy, we see a strong correllation of -.89. In other words, places with high temperatures tend to have fewer trees.

``` {r}

#### Build correlation matrix ####
csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(temp_mean_aft,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  correlate() %>%
  mutate(variable=rowname) %>%
  select(variable, everything(), -rowname)

```

We can also view the data ranked by temperature:

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         temp_mean_aft,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  mutate(rank_temp = rank(-temp_mean_aft),
         rank_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015)) %>%
  arrange(temp_mean_aft)

```

The coolest CSA has 11 times as much canopy cover as the hottest:

```{r}
(csa_tree_temp_demographics$`15_lid_mean`[(csa_tree_temp_demographics$temp_mean_aft == min(csa_tree_temp_demographics$temp_mean_aft))]) / 
  (csa_tree_temp_demographics$`15_lid_mean`[(csa_tree_temp_demographics$temp_mean_aft == max(csa_tree_temp_demographics$temp_mean_aft))])
```

This order of magnitude jump holds true for the second-hottest CSA, but ends at the third.

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         temp_mean_aft,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  mutate(rank_temp = rank(-temp_mean_aft),
         rank_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015)) %>%
  filter(between(rank_temp, 1L, 5L) |
           between(rank_temp, 51L, 55L)) %>%
  arrange(rank_temp)

```

### Tree canopy change over time

All relevant data:

```{r, columns.print=7}

nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name,
         avg_canopy_2007 = `07_lid_mean`,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`,
         lid_change_percent,
         lid_change_percent_point) %>%
  mutate(is_target_nsa = case_when(
    nsa_name %in% target_nsas ~ T,
    TRUE ~ F 
  )) %>%
  mutate(rank_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015))
  # filter(between(rank_canopy, 1L, 5L) |
  #          between(rank_canopy, 51L, 55L)) %>%
  # arrange(rank_canopy)

```

What were the citywide gains and losses?

```{r}

#### INCOMPLETE: WILL USE QGIS TO DO THIS CONFIRMATION ####

```

How many geographies gained and lost tree cover?

```{r}

#### NSAs ####
as.data.frame(table(sign(nsa_tree_temp$lid_change_percent))) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(Freq),
         perc = round(100*(Freq/total), 2))

#### Blocks ####
as.data.frame(table(sign(blocks_tree_temp_demographics$lid_change_percent))) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(Freq),
         perc = round(100*(Freq/total), 2))

```

By how many percentage points did each NSA of interest gain or lose?

```{r rows.print=17}

nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, `07_lid_mean`, `15_lid_mean`, lid_change_percent_point) %>%
  filter((nsa_name %in% target_nsas) | (nsa_name %like% "%roland%")) %>%
  mutate(lid_change_percent_point = round(lid_change_percent_point*100, 2),
         `07_lid_mean` = round(`07_lid_mean`*100, 2),
         `15_lid_mean` = round(`15_lid_mean`*100, 2))

```

### Tree cover in redlined areas 

``` {r}
redlining_tree %>%
  group_by(holc_grade, grade_descr) %>%
  summarise(total_area_pixels = sum(`count_all_pix_15`),
            total_canopy_pixels = sum(`sum_canopy_pix_15`)) %>%
  mutate(avg_canopy_perc = round(100*(total_canopy_pixels/total_area_pixels), 2))
```

It is clear that taller trees are more common in wealthier NSAs compared to poorer ones such as Broadway East.

### Difficulty of planting

In addition to tracking each tree, the City of Baltimore also tracks spaces where trees could potentiall by planted. This, along with methodology for determining ease-of-planting classifications, is further explained in the [Code Red Data Cleaning document](https://github.com/smussenden/2019-baltimore-climate-health-project-data-repo/blob/master/documentation/code-red-data-cleaning.md#load-and-clean-individual-tree-data).

``` {r, rows.print=19}

#### Relevant info from table ####
street_trees_nsa_summarized %>%
  select(1:33) %>%
  filter((nbrdesc %in% target_nsas) | (nbrdesc %in% counterpoint_nsas))
  
```

Not only are there more trees in Roland Park than Broadway East, but the untreed spaces are considerably easier to plant.

``` {r, rows.print=11}

#### Summarize planting difficulty in Broadway East and Roland Park ####
street_trees_nsa_categorized %>%
  select(nbrdesc, difficulty_level_num, difficulty_level) %>%
  filter((nbrdesc %like% "broadway%") | (nbrdesc %like% "roland%")) %>%
  group_by(nbrdesc, difficulty_level_num, difficulty_level) %>%
  summarize(count_spaces = n())
  
```

Broadway East has 1140 spaces that are available for planting, 1025 of which are not considered "unsuitable." 96 percent of these are hard to plant (require breaking concrete). 

```{r, columns.print=7}

#### Find percent of suitable spaces at each difficulty level for... ####

# ...Broadway East
street_trees_nsa_categorized %>%
  # Count the spaces at each level
  select(nbrdesc, difficulty_level_num, difficulty_level) %>%

### Condition of trees

Larger (and therefore older) trees in the south-eastern neighborhoods tend to be less healthy than those in the northwest. 

``` {r}

#### Relevant info from table ####
street_trees_nsa_categorized %>%
  select(nbrdesc, diameter = dbh, condition, is_target_nsa)

```

When looking at larger trees, Roland Park is ranked 28th in for percent in good condition. Broadway East, by contrast, is ranked 227th of 277 NSAs.

``` {r, rows.print = 19}

#### Find counts of each tree condition in NSAs of interest, and calculate the percentage that are in good condition ####
street_trees_nsa_categorized %>%
  select(nbrdesc, diameter = dbh, condition) %>%
  # Filter for only trees with diameter larger than 6 inches
  filter(diameter > 6) %>%
  group_by(nbrdesc, condition) %>%
  summarize(count_at_condition = n()) %>%
  spread(condition, count_at_condition) %>%
  # Drop non-live trees
  select(-absent, -unknown, -dead, -stump) %>%
  # Arrange in sensible order
  select(poor, fair, good) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Find percent
  mutate(total_live_trees = rowSums(.[2:4]),
         perc_good = round(100*(good/total_live_trees), 2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(perc_good)) %>%
  # Rank by percent
  mutate(rank_by_perc_good = rank(-perc_good)) %>%
  # Filter for NSAs of interest
  filter((nbrdesc %in% target_nsas) | (nbrdesc %in% counterpoint_nsas))

```

### Individual street trees

The story references a number of trees in Broadway East along N. Milton Avenue and E. Lanvale Street. All trees and potential tree locations along those stretches of road are referenced below:

```{r, rows.print = 25}

street_trees_nsa_categorized %>%
  filter((nbrdesc %like% "broadway%") & ((street %like% "n milton%") | (street %like% "%lanvale%"))) %>%
  select(nbrdesc, address, street, genus_clean, common, dbh, condition, date_inspected = inspect_dt) %>%
  arrange(street, address)

```
