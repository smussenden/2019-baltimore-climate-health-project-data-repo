## Introduction

This R markdown document describes the methodology and results of a portion of the data analysis we conducted in support of a reporting project examining the effects of tree canopy inequity across the city of Baltimore, especially as it relates to climate change.

In general, this document is arranged into analyses of the following categories, though there are some cases where one statistic depends on multiple categories (e.g. the canopy cover in a hot neighborhood):

* Temperature
* Demographics
* Tree Canopy
* Street Trees (individual tree tracking)

## Temperature Analysis

### Blocks by temperature 

The following arranges and ranks blocks across the city by temperature in the afternoon of August 29, 2018:

```{r}

blocks_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(geoid10, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  arrange(rank)

```

Below, we see the block on N. Milton Avenue between Oliver and Federal is one of the city's hottest, ranking at 236 out of 13,598 blocks. The block GEOID for this block was pulled from QGIS and breaks down into the following codes:

* State: 24
* County: 510
* Tract: 080301
* Block: 1000

```{r}

blocks_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(geoid10, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  filter(geoid10 == "245100803011000")

```

### Neighborhood Statistical Areas by temperature

The following arranges and ranks NSAs across the city by temperature in the afternoon of August 29, 2018.

First, we can see that all of the top 10 hottest NSAs are located in the south of the city, and many are in the south-east.

```{r}

# Top 10 hottest neighborhoods
nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  arrange(rank)

```

Looking at the 10 coolest NSAs, we see it is generally true that they are located far to the west and north, on the outskirts of Baltimore.

```{r}

# Top 10 coolest neighborhoods
nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  arrange(desc(rank))

```

Below we see:

* McElderry Park was the hottest, at 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Gwynns Falls/Leakin Park was the coolest, at 90.8 degrees Fahrenheit.

```{r}

nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  filter((temp_mean_aft == min(temp_mean_aft)) | (temp_mean_aft == max(temp_mean_aft))) %>%
  arrange(desc(temp_mean_aft))

```

The difference in temperatures between the city's hottest and coolest neighborhoods is `r round((min(nsa_tree_temp$temp_mean_aft)) - (max(nsa_tree_temp$temp_mean_aft)), 2)` degrees Fahrenheit.

Below, we see the relative ranks of the Broadway East and Roland Park neighborhoods, placing Roland Park at 263 out of 278 neighborhoods, while Roland Park is ranked at 16.

```{r}

nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, temp_mean_aft) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-temp_mean_aft)) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  filter((nsa_name %like% "roland park") | nsa_name %like% ("broadway east"))

```

These data are visualized in the following choropleth map, which was exported from QGIS and prettified slightly in Illustrator:

<img src="../documentation/choropleth-temperature-full-withlines-01.png" width="400" alt="Choropleth map of temperatures across Baltimore NSAs" />

## Demographics Analysis

For the demographic anaylsis, we used CSA rather than NSA geographic segments, for reasons explained in the [Code Red Data Cleaning document](https://github.com/smussenden/2019-baltimore-climate-health-project-data-repo/blob/master/documentation/code-red-data-cleaning.md). The CSAs and NSAs do not allign completely.

First, the top 10 CSAs ranked by percent of families living below the poverty line:

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         avg_household_income = median_household_income, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line) %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-perc_below_poverty)) %>%
  arrange(rank)

```

Next, we see only the CSAs containing the NSAs mentioned in the story, ranked by percent of families living below the poverty line (out of 55 ranks).

* The **Broadway East** NSA is split vertically down the middle between the **Clifton-Berea** and **Greenmount East** CSAs, which also include large portions of the surrounding NSAs. It also includes an insignificant sliver of Oldtown/Middle East, which was disregarded in this analysis.
* The **McElderry Park** NSA is split horizontally across the middle between **Madison/East End** and **Patterson Park North & East**, both of which contain large portions of surrounding NSAs. 
* The **Roland Park** NSA is almost completely contained within the **Greater Roland Park/Poplar Hill** CSA. A small southern slice extends into the Medfield/Hampden/Woodberry/Remington CSA, but that CSA extends so far south as to be non-representative of most of Roland Park and was disregarded in this analysis.

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  mutate(rank = rank(-percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line)) %>%
  arrange(rank) %>%
  mutate(associated_nsa = case_when(
    (csa2010 %like% "%clifton%") | (csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%") ~ "broadway east",
    (csa2010 %like% "%madison%") | (csa2010 %like% "%park north%") ~ "mcelderry park",
    (csa2010 %like% "%poplar%") ~ "roland park",
    T ~ NA_character_
  )) %>%
  select(csa2010, associated_nsa, 
         avg_household_income = median_household_income, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line, 
         rank) %>%
  filter((csa2010 %like% "%clifton%") | 
           (csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%madison%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%park north%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%poplar%"))

```

Broadway East, as a combination of Clifton-Berea and Greenmount East, has a total percent of family households living below the poverty line of `r round((csa_tree_temp_demographics$percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line[csa_tree_temp_demographics$csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%"] +
csa_tree_temp_demographics$percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line[csa_tree_temp_demographics$csa2010 %like% "%clifton%"]) / 2, 2)` according to:

```{r}

(csa_tree_temp_demographics$percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line[csa_tree_temp_demographics$csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%"] +
csa_tree_temp_demographics$percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line[csa_tree_temp_demographics$csa2010 %like% "%clifton%"]) / 2

```

## Tree Canopy Analysis

As further explained in the [Code Red Data Cleaning document](https://github.com/smussenden/2019-baltimore-climate-health-project-data-repo/blob/master/documentation/code-red-data-cleaning.md), the following tree canopy data is based on LIDAR data from 2015. 

### Poverty compared to tree canopy

A correlation matrix of poverty and canopy cover shows a weak negative correlation of -.34. In other words, places with a high poverty rate will have fewer trees, in general.

``` {r}

#### Build correlation matrix ####
csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  correlate() %>%
  mutate(variable=rowname) %>%
  select(variable, everything(), -rowname)

```

Here are the data related to poverty, income and canopy at the top and bottom five CSAs when ranked for poverty:

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         avg_household_income = median_household_income, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  mutate(rank_poverty = rank(-perc_below_poverty),
         rank_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015)) %>%
  filter(between(rank_poverty, 1L, 5L) |
           between(rank_poverty, 51L, 55L)) %>%
  arrange(rank_poverty)

```

Looking again at only the NSAs of interest in the story:

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  mutate(rank_perc_poverty = rank(-percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line),
         rank_perc_canopy = rank(-`15_lid_mean`)) %>%
  arrange(rank_perc_canopy) %>%
  mutate(associated_nsa = case_when(
    (csa2010 %like% "%clifton%") | (csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%") ~ "broadway east",
    (csa2010 %like% "%madison%") | (csa2010 %like% "%park north%") ~ "mcelderry park",
    (csa2010 %like% "%poplar%") ~ "roland park",
    T ~ NA_character_
  )) %>%
  select(csa2010, associated_nsa, 
         avg_household_income = median_household_income, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line, 
         perc_canopy = `15_lid_mean`,
         rank_perc_poverty,
         rank_perc_canopy) %>%
  filter((csa2010 %like% "%clifton%") | 
           (csa2010 %like% "%greenmount%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%madison%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%park north%") |
           (csa2010 %like% "%poplar%"))

```

If we build a correlation matrix only looking at certain neighborhoods of interest, the pattern is even more pronounced:

``` {r}

#### Build correlation matrix ####
csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  filter(csa2010 %in% target_csas) %>%
  select(perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  correlate() %>%
  mutate(variable=rowname) %>%
  select(variable, everything(), -rowname)

```

Below is the trend viewed graphically:

``` {r}

# CSAs to call out
callout_ls <- c("Canton", "Clifton-Berea", "Greater Roland Park/Poplar Hill", "Greenmount East")

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%

  # Start ggplot and set x and y for entire plot

                      # Patterson Park must be included seperately because of its unique label positioning
                      | (csa2010 == "Patterson Park North & East") 
                      ),
             aes(color = `07_lid_mean`),

  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(data = csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
                              mutate_at(vars("csa2010"), str_to_title) %>%
                              filter(csa2010 %in% callout_ls) %>%
                              mutate(csa2010 = case_when(
                                csa2010 == "Greenmount East" ~ "Greenmount East \n(includes part of Broadway East)", 
                                csa2010 == "Clifton-Berea" ~ "Clifton-Berea \n(includes part of Broadway East)",
                                T ~ csa2010)),
            aes(label = csa2010),
            min.segment.length = .1,
            segment.alpha = .5,
            alpha = .85,
            nudge_x = .05,
            nudge_y = .06) +
  # This section for labeling Patterson Park (so its label can be nudged)
  ggrepel::geom_label_repel(data = csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
                              mutate_at(vars("csa2010"), str_to_title) %>%
                              filter(csa2010 == "Patterson Park North & East") %>%
                              mutate(csa2010 = case_when(
                                csa2010 == "Patterson Park North & East" ~ "Patterson Park North & East \n(includes most of McElderry Park)",
                                T ~ csa2010)),
                            aes(label = csa2010),
                            min.segment.length = .1,
                            segment.alpha = .5,
                            alpha = .85,
                            nudge_x = -.06,

```

There are some exceptions to this trend, such as Penn North/Reservoir Hill and Greater Rosemont, which both have relatively high rates of both poverty and tree canopy:

``` {r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         perc_below_poverty = percent_of_family_households_living_below_the_poverty_line,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  mutate(rank_perc_poverty = rank(-perc_below_poverty),
         rank_perc_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015)) %>%
  arrange(rank_perc_canopy) %>%
  filter((csa2010 %like% "%penn north%") | (csa2010 %like% "%rosemont%"))

```

Average canopy cover by NSA is visualized in the following choropleth map, which was exported from QGIS and prettified slightly in Illustrator:

<img src="../documentation/choropleth-canopy-full-withlines-01.png" width="400" alt="Choropleth map of temperatures across Baltimore NSAs" />

### Temperature compared to tree canopy

When comparing temperature to tree canopy, we see a strong correllation of -.89. In other words, places with high temperatures tend to have fewer trees.

``` {r}

#### Build correlation matrix ####
csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(temp_mean_aft,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  as.matrix() %>%
  correlate() %>%
  mutate(variable=rowname) %>%
  select(variable, everything(), -rowname)

```

We can also view the data ranked by temperature:

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         temp_mean_aft,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  mutate(rank_temp = rank(-temp_mean_aft),
         rank_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015)) %>%
  arrange(temp_mean_aft)

```

The coolest CSA has 11 times as much canopy cover as the hottest:

```{r}
(csa_tree_temp_demographics$`15_lid_mean`[(csa_tree_temp_demographics$temp_mean_aft == min(csa_tree_temp_demographics$temp_mean_aft))]) / 
  (csa_tree_temp_demographics$`15_lid_mean`[(csa_tree_temp_demographics$temp_mean_aft == max(csa_tree_temp_demographics$temp_mean_aft))])
```

This order of magnitude jump holds true for the second-hottest CSA, but ends at the third.

```{r}

csa_tree_temp_demographics %>%
  select(csa2010, 
         temp_mean_aft,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`) %>%
  mutate(rank_temp = rank(-temp_mean_aft),
         rank_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015)) %>%
  filter(between(rank_temp, 1L, 5L) |
           between(rank_temp, 51L, 55L)) %>%
  arrange(rank_temp)

```

### Tree canopy change over time

All relevant data:

```{r}

nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name,
         avg_canopy_2007 = `07_lid_mean`,
         avg_canopy_2015 = `15_lid_mean`,
         lid_change_percent,
         lid_change_percent_point) %>%
  mutate(is_target_nsa = case_when(
    nsa_name %in% target_nsas ~ T,
    TRUE ~ F 
  )) %>%
  mutate(rank_canopy = rank(-avg_canopy_2015))
  # filter(between(rank_canopy, 1L, 5L) |
  #          between(rank_canopy, 51L, 55L)) %>%
  # arrange(rank_canopy)

```

What were the citywide gains and losses?

```{r}

#### INCOMPLETE: WILL USE QGIS TO DO THIS CONFIRMATION ####

```

How many geographies gained and lost tree cover?

```{r}

#### NSAs ####
as.data.frame(table(sign(nsa_tree_temp$lid_change_percent))) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(Freq),
         perc = round(100*(Freq/total), 2))

#### Blocks ####
as.data.frame(table(sign(blocks_tree_temp_demographics$lid_change_percent))) %>%
  mutate(total = sum(Freq),
         perc = round(100*(Freq/total), 2))

```

By how many percentage points did each NSA of interest gain or lose?

```{r rows.print=16}

nsa_tree_temp %>%
  select(nsa_name, `07_lid_mean`, `15_lid_mean`, lid_change_percent_point) %>%
  filter((nsa_name %in% target_nsas) | (nsa_name %like% "%roland%")) %>%
  mutate(lid_change_percent_point = round(lid_change_percent_point*100, 2),
         `07_lid_mean` = round(`07_lid_mean`*100, 2),
         `15_lid_mean` = round(`15_lid_mean`*100, 2))

```

  group_by(holc_grade, grade_descr) %>%
