## Code Red: Baltimore's Climate Divide

This repo includes data and R code necessary to reproduce a portion of the data analysis for a reporting project examining the effects of climate-change driven temperature increases on the health of people who live in cities.  The project was done in partnership with the [University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism](
), [Capital News Service](https://cnsmaryland.org/), [the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism](https://merrill.umd.edu/about-merrill/signature-programs/the-howard-center-for-investigative-journalism/), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/), [Wide Angle Youth Media](https://www.wideanglemedia.org/) and [WMAR](https://www.wmar2news.com/). It also moved on the Associated Press wire.
