# Memo - NSA Street Tree Analysis - Week of July 1

_INCOMPLETE_

## Definitions
* **NSAs** (277): Neighborhood Statistical Areas
  * Citywide calculations are controled for neighborhoods with at least 50 trees (252 remaining).
* **Neighborhoods of interest** (18): The following NSAs are considered neighbhorhoods of interest:
  * **Target neighborhoods** (15): "Berea", "Broadway East", "Oliver", "Middle East", "Biddle Street","Milton-Montford", "Madison-Eastend", "CARE", "McElderry Park", "Ellwood Park/Monument", "Patterson Place", "Patterson Park Neighborhood", "Baltimore Highlands", "Highlandtown", "Upper Fells Point"
  * **Counterpoint neighborhoods** (3 nearby NSAs that are richer than the target NSAs): "Butcher's Hill", "Canton", "Washington Hill"


## Summary

Target neighborhoods range in rank from 22nd (Patterson Park) to 162nd (Patterson Place) for number of trees, and most are in the top 100 for health of trees (Patterson Park, Oliver, CARE, and Broadway East are the only four NSAs ranking below the top 100).

However, most of these trees appear to be new plantings which have not had time to succumb to disease, weather or consequences of poor maintenance.

## Details

### Tree Height / Diameter

* **Height**: All target neighborhoods are in the bottom 100, spread between ranks 121 (Upper Fells Point) and last at 252 (Madison-Eastend).
* **Diameter**: All target neighborhoods are in the bottom 150, spread between ranks 162 (Broadway East) and last at 252 (Milton-Montford).

Target neighborhoods' median average diameter is 5.54 inches and the mean is 6.1 inches. By contrast, the median average diameter citywide is 11.6 inches and the mean is 12.1 inches, both double that of the target NSAs.

Most of the target neighborhoods are in the top 50 for greatest percent of young trees. In other words, the target NSAs have a greater percentage of young trees compared to live trees than do other neighborhoods in the city.

Three of the top 5 areas for both tallest trees and largest tree diameter are counterpoint neighborhoods. The same NSAs populate both groups; only the order is changed.
