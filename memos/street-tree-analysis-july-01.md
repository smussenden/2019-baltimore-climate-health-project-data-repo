# Memo - NSA Street Tree Analysis - Week of July 1

_INCOMPLETE_

## Definitions
* **NSAs** (277): Neighborhood Statistical Areas
* **Neighborhoods of interest** (18): The following NSAs are considered neighbhorhoods of interest:
  * **Target neighborhoods** (15): "Berea", "Broadway East", "Oliver", "Middle East", "Biddle Street","Milton-Montford", "Madison-Eastend", "CARE", "McElderry Park", "Ellwood Park/Monument", "Patterson Place", "Patterson Park Neighborhood", "Baltimore Highlands", "Highlandtown", "Upper Fells Point"
  * **Counterpoint neighborhoods** (3 nearby NSAs that are richer than the target NSAs): "Butcher's Hill", "Canton", "Washington Hill"
* Citywide calculations are controled for neighborhoods with at least 50 trees, for a total of 252 neighborhoods out of the total 277.

## Summary

Our target neighborhoods range in rank from 22nd to 162nd for number of trees, and most are in the top 100 for health of trees (Patterson Park, Oliver, CARE, and Broadway East are the only four NSAs ranking at > 100).

However, most of these trees appear to be new plantings, as these neighborhoods' average tree diameters are ranked from 159 to last, with a median average diameter of 5.54 inches and a mean of 6.1 inches. By contrast, the median average diameter citywide is 11.6 inches and a mean of 12.1 inches, both double that of the targets.

## Details

### Tree Height / Diameter

#### Citywide
* **Height**: All target neighborhoods are in the bottom 100, spread between ranks 121 (Upper Fells Point) and 252 (Madison-Eastend).
* **Diameter**: all target neighborhoods are in the bottom 150, spread between ranks 162 (Broadway East) and last at 252 (Milton-Montford).

#### Within the target NSAs
Three of the top 5 areas for both tallest trees and largest tree diameter are counterpoint neighborhoods. The same NSAs populate both groups; only the order is changed.

| The 5 NSAs of interest with the tallest trees are: | The 5 NSAs of interest with the largest tree diameter are: |
