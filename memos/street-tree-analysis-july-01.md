## Definitions
* **NSAs** (277): Neighborhood Statistical Areas
* **Neighborhoods of interest** (18): The following NSAs are considered neighbhorhoods of interest:
  * **Target neighborhoods** (15): "Berea", "Broadway East", "Oliver", "Middle East", "Biddle Street","Milton-Montford", "Madison-Eastend", "CARE", "McElderry Park", "Ellwood Park/Monument", "Patterson Place", "Patterson Park Neighborhood", "Baltimore Highlands", "Highlandtown", "Upper Fells Point"
  * **Counterpoint neighborhoods** (3 nearby NSAs that are richer than the target NSAs): "Butcher's Hill", "Canton", "Washington Hill"

## Details

### Tree Height / Diameter
All height/diameter rankings consider only NSAs with at least 100 live trees, making the sample set 234 [NEED TO VERIFY THIS COUNT BEFORE PUBLICATION] out of the original 277. 

#### Citywide
* **Height**: All target neighborhoods are in the bottom 100, spread between ranks 109 (Upper Fells Point) and 233 (Madison-Eastend).
* **Diameter**: all target neighborhoods are in the bottom 150, spread between ranks 159 (Broadway East) and 234 (Milton-Montford).

#### Within the target NSAs
Three of the top 5 areas for both tallest trees and largest tree diameter are counterpoint neighborhoods. The same NSAs populate both groups; only the order is changed.

| The 5 NSAs of interest with the tallest trees are: | The 5 NSAs of interest with the largest tree diameter are: |
