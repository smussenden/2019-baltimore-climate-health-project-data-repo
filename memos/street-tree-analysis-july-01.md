# Memo - NSA Street Tree Analysis - Week of July 1

_INCOMPLETE_

## Definitions
* **NSAs** (277): Neighborhood Statistical Areas
  * Citywide calculations are controled for neighborhoods with at least 50 trees (252 remaining).
* **Neighborhoods of interest** (18): The following NSAs are considered neighbhorhoods of interest:
  * **Target neighborhoods** (15): "Berea", "Broadway East", "Oliver", "Middle East", "Biddle Street","Milton-Montford", "Madison-Eastend", "CARE", "McElderry Park", "Ellwood Park/Monument", "Patterson Place", "Patterson Park Neighborhood", "Baltimore Highlands", "Highlandtown", "Upper Fells Point"
  * **Counterpoint neighborhoods** (3 nearby NSAs that are richer than the target NSAs): "Butcher's Hill", "Canton", "Washington Hill"
  
### Example Trees 
* Biggest tree in Broadway East (that's not in a park) has a 33 inch trunk (1600 North Washington Street). It is in "good" condition. This tree is huge for this area, where most tree trunks are just a few inches across. But it would be middling in Roland Park, where 146 trees have trunks of that size or larger, and three dozen have trunks of 40 inches across or more.
* The largest tree in Roland Park is 68 inches across (3901 Beech Ave). It is in "fair" condition.


## Summary

Target neighborhoods range in rank from 22nd (Patterson Park) to 162nd (Patterson Place) for number of trees, and most are in the top 100 for health of trees (Patterson Park, Oliver, CARE, and Broadway East are the only four NSAs ranking below the top 100).

However, most of these trees appear to be new plantings which have not had time to succumb to disease, weather or consequences of poor maintenance.

## Details

### Tree Height / Diameter

* **Height**: All target neighborhoods are in the bottom 100, spread between ranks 121 (Upper Fells Point) and last at 252 (Madison-Eastend).
* **Diameter**: All target neighborhoods are in the bottom 150, spread between ranks 162 (Broadway East) and last at 252 (Milton-Montford).

Three of the top 5 areas for both tallest trees and largest tree diameter are counterpoint neighborhoods. The same NSAs populate both groups; only the order is changed.

| The 5 NSAs of interest with the tallest trees are: | The 5 NSAs of interest with the largest tree diameter are: |

Target neighborhoods' median average diameter is 5.54 inches and the mean is 6.1 inches. By contrast, the median average diameter citywide is 11.6 inches and the mean is 12.1 inches, both double that of the target NSAs. 

Most of the target neighborhoods are in the top 50 for greatest percent of young trees. In other words, the target NSAs have a greater percentage of young trees compared to live trees than do other neighborhoods in the city.

### Condition

Most target neighborhoods are in the bottom 100 for percent of trees in good condition when controled for older trees (>6 inch diameter trunk), though Upper Fells Point and Patterson Park Neighborhood are ranked at 24 and 61, respectively.
