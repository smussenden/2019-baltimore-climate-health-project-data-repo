# Memo - NSA Street Tree Analysis - Week of July 1

_INCOMPLETE_

## Definitions
* **NSAs** (277): Neighborhood Statistical Areas
  * Citywide calculations are controled for neighborhoods with at least 50 trees (252 remaining).
* **Neighborhoods of interest** (18): The following NSAs are considered neighbhorhoods of interest:
  * **Target neighborhoods** (15): "Berea", "Broadway East", "Oliver", "Middle East", "Biddle Street","Milton-Montford", "Madison-Eastend", "CARE", "McElderry Park", "Ellwood Park/Monument", "Patterson Place", "Patterson Park Neighborhood", "Baltimore Highlands", "Highlandtown", "Upper Fells Point"
  * **Counterpoint neighborhoods** (3 nearby NSAs that are richer than the target NSAs): "Butcher's Hill", "Canton", "Washington Hill"


## Summary

Target neighborhoods range in rank from 22nd (Patterson Park) to 162nd (Patterson Place) for number of trees, and most are in the top 100 for health of trees (Patterson Park, Oliver, CARE, and Broadway East are the only four NSAs ranking below the top 100).

However, most of these trees appear to be new plantings which have not had time to succumb to disease, weather or consequences of poor maintenance. The target neighborhoods have significantly higher rates of young trees than others in the city, with most falling in the top 50% for percent of young trees to older trees (based on trunk diameter). 

When controled to consider only the condition of younger trees, all but two of the target neighborhoods fall into the bottom half for trees in "good" condition. It should be noted, however, that the target NSAs are evenly distributed across the city in terms of percent of trees in "poor" condition, so most of the disparity rests in the middle condition, "fair."


### Neighborhood Observations / Example trees
#### Citywide
* 118,628 trees
* 91,529 non-park trees (23%; difference: 27,099)
* The tallest tree in the city (that is not in a park) is in front of 6212 Woodcrest Ave: 120' tall, 35.8" diameter trunk, fair condition.
* The tree with the largest diameter (that is not in a park) is (or was?) in front of 204 Saint Dunstans Road: 86" across, 60' tall, poor condition marked for removal.
* The next-largest-diameter tree (not in a park) is in a forest front of 5606 Wildwood Lane: 72" across, 60' tall, fair condition
* There's a tree almost as large as the one on Wildwood Lane (70" across, 60' tall) behind 6151 Metro Dr that would probably be easier to get a picture of, though I couldn't find it for certain on G Maps.

#### Broadway East
* 386 trees
* 303 non-park trees (21%; difference: 83)
* Largest-diameter tree in Broadway East (that's not in a park) has a 33" trunk and is 50' tall (1600 North Washington Street). It is in "good" condition. This tree is huge for this area, where most tree trunks are just a few inches across. But it would be middling in Roland Park (see below).
* The tallest tree is 55' tall and 24" across, on the side of 1420 N. Milton Ave. "Good" condition.
* The largest (height and width) poor-condition tree is on the side of 1746 E. Lafayette Ave: 30" wide, 45' tall.

#### Roland Park
* 2,910 trees
* 2,871 non-park trees (1%; difference: 39)
* In RP, 146 trees have trunks of the Broadway East's largest size or larger.
* Three dozen have trunks of 40 inches across or more.
* The largest-diameter tree in Roland Park is 68 inches across (3901 Beech Ave). It is in "fair" condition.

#### Baltimore Highlands
* 411 trees
* 411 non-park trees (difference: 0)
* Many larger trees along Roberts Place road
* Trees on Conkling, Esther and Dean are likely to be park trees.
* The tallest non-park tree in BH is on 3600 Pulaski Hwy: 40' tall, fair condition, 33.8" diameter, in well/pit.
* The largest-diameter tree in BH is alegedly a 41" multi-stem 30' tree in an open/unrestricted space on 3800 E Lombard St, but nothing on Google Maps matches that description. Worth checking out but it's a semi-industrial area.
* 3525 E Fayette St: Poor condition 25' tree scheduled for removal due to "mechanical damage," "poor root system."
* 4001 E Lombard St: Poor condition 20' tree scheduled for removal due to "mechanical damage."

#### Patterson Place
* 240 trees
* 240 non-park trees (difference: 0)
* The largest (diameter and height) tree in PP in poor condition is a tree in front of 2400 E Baltimore St: 14.4" diameter, 45' tall, poor condition.
* Another large tree, in fair condition, is on the side of the same building (possibly on N. Montford).
* The south end of Montford has a number of PP's larger trees.
* Sad-looking 40' tree at 114 N. Milton Ave marked "poor," "priority prune." (It's marked well/pit but looks like a planter/raised-bed on G Maps.)
  
#### McElderry Park
* 751 trees
* 743 non-park trees (1%; difference: 8)
* Tallest: front of 510 N Milton Ave, 45' tall, 14.4" across, "good" condition
* Widest: side of 2711 Jefferson St, 32.2" wide, 40' tall, "fair" condition

#### Madison East End
* 451 trees
* 373 non-park trees (17%; difference: 78)
* Tallest: front of 912 N Lakewood Ave, 40' tall, 17.6" across, "good" condition
* Widest: side of 3021 E Madison St, 23.8" across, 40' tall, "poor" condition
  

## Tree Height / Diameter

* **Height**: All target neighborhoods are in the bottom half, spread between ranks 121 (Upper Fells Point) and last at 252 (Madison-Eastend).
* **Diameter**: All target neighborhoods are in the bottom 150, spread between ranks 162 (Broadway East) and last at 252 (Milton-Montford).

When considering only neighborhoods of interest, three of the top 5 areas for both tallest trees and largest tree diameter are counterpoint neighborhoods. The same NSAs populate both groups; only the order is changed.

Target neighborhoods' median average diameter is 5.54 inches and the mean is 6.1 inches. By contrast, the median average diameter citywide is 11.6 inches and the mean is 12.1 inches, both double that of the target NSAs. 

Most of the target neighborhoods are in the top 50 for greatest percent of young trees. In other words, the target NSAs have a greater percentage of young trees compared to live trees than do other neighborhoods in the city.

The charts below show this as a pronounced shift toward the left of the graph for target NSAs compared with the top 15 NSAs with the largest trees.

## Condition

Most target neighborhoods are in the bottom half for percent of trees in good condition when controled for older trees (>6 inch diameter trunk), though Upper Fells Point and Patterson Park Neighborhood are ranked at 24 and 61, respectively.

However, target NSAs are distributed equally among other neighborhoods for percent of trees in poor condition.
