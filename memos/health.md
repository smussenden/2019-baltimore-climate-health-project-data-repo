# Baltimore Climate Project Heat and Health findings

#### Overall Findings

People with chronic medical conditions exacerbated by high temperatures will be particularly vulnerable as the planet warms, public health officials warn. These chronic conditions exacerbated by extreme temperature include respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD; heart disease; diabetes; and kidney disease. 

To understand how temperature increases will affect people in Baltimore, Capital News Service analyzed data describing inpatient hospital visits, emergency room visits, emergency medical (EMS) response calls, demographic information and ZIP-code level temperature variations measured in a landmark 2018 study of the urban heat island in the city. 

Our topline findings:

* The hottest parts of Baltimore in the summer also have the highest rates of people with asthma and COPD. In Baltimore, it's an unfortunate twist of fate that there are more sick people in the hottest areas who have these two chronic diseases exacerbated by extreme heat, when compared with people who live in cooler areas. For the population at large, we did not observe a similar pattern with diabetes, kidney disease or heart disease.      

* Poor people in the hottest parts of Baltimore in the summer also have higher rates of asthma and COPD, when compared with poor people in the coolest parts.  Poor people in the hottest parts of the city also have higher rates of diabetes and heart disease, when compared with poor people in the coolest parts. 

* In explaining the variance we see in disease rates -- both for the population at large and for poor people on Medicaid -- neighborhood-level markers of poverty are much more important than markers of neighborhood temperature, though temperature does have explanatory power. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that there is also a relationship between temperature and poverty in Baltimore.  It's important to note that our analysis did not establish a causal relationship between neighborhood temperature and disease prevalance.

* Last summer in Baltimore (June 21 to September 20), emergency response calls increased for the following conditions when the heat index went above the National Weather Service's approximate cutoff for "dangerous" heat index conditions (~103 degrees), compared with calls during cooler temperatures during the summer: Asthma, behavioral/psychiatric disorders, cardiac arrest, COPD, dehydration, diabetic hypoglycemia, end stage renal disease, heat exhuastion, hypertension, hypotension, obvious death, fainting, drug/alcohol overdose/withdrawal. Common conditions of note that didn't increase when the temperature increased: Generic respiratory distress, diabetic hyperglycemia. 

* Examining the entire time period between January 1, 2014 and November 30, 2018, the following conditions increased when the heat index went above the National Weather Service's approxmiate cutoff for "dangerous" heat index conditions (~103 degrees), compared with cooler temperatures during the entire 4 year, 11 month period: Behavioral/psychiatric disorders, cardiac arrest, COPD, dehydration, diabetic hyperglycemia, diabetic hypoglycemia, dizziness,  end stage renal disease, heat exhaustion, hypertension, hyperthermia, hypotension, obvious death, drug/alcohol overdose/withdrawal. Common conditions of note that didn't increase when the temperature increased: asthma, generic respiratory distress.  


### Hospital Analysis - Data and Methods

Capital News Service obtained data describing inpatient and emergency room admissions at Maryland hospitals from the Health Services Cost Review Commission for FY2014 to FY2019, which includes information about diagnoses for each visit by a patient, the patient's ZIP code, insurance payer, race and other information.  We obtained information on ZIP Code level temperature variation by processing data from a team of researchers who captured block-by-block temperature data in Baltimore on August 29. 2018 showing variation in the city's urban heat island. We obtained ZIP Code level demographic and economic information from the U.S. Census bureau's American Community Survey from 2017.  Using these three data sets -- and additional information from the CDC on disease prevalance for select conditions -- we were able to examine relationships between heat, demographics and health condition prevalance.  https://osf.io/e63x9/


### Hospital Data Analysis - Detailed Findings

Through our analysis, we found a general trend that showed the hottest ZIP Codes of Baltimore in the summer also have the highest rates of people with asthma and COPD. 

There was a significant positive correlation between the percentage of hospital visits by people between 2014 and 2019 from a given ZIP Code who were diagnosed with asthma or COPD and the ZIP Code's median afternoon temperature as measured by in the urban heat island study. The hotter the temperature, the higher the asthma rate.

The correlation coefficient (r) for COPD was .61 (on a scale from -1, perfect negative correlation, to 1, perfect positive correlation), a moderately strong relationship. Asthma, had a moderate positive correlation coefficient of .50. Using the determination coefficient (r-squared), the value for COPD was .37, and the value for asthma was .25. 

This comparison helps exemplify the general trend.  ZIP Code 21209, a leafy area in Northwest Baltimore, had the lowest median afternoon temperature in the urban heat island study, 93.1 degrees and the city's third lowest asthma rate (8 percent). ZIP Code 21205, a concrete-heavy area of East Baltimore that includes parts of McElderry Park, had the city's fifth-highest median afternoon temperature, 95.74 degrees and the second highest asthma rate (16.8 percent).

Here, it's important to note that we're not taking about causation.  We have not established evidence that heat caused the variations we observed.  But our analysis does allow us to say this: In Baltimore, it's an unfortunate twist of fate that there is a greater concentration of people in the hottest areas who have chronic respiratory diseases exacerbated by extreme heat, when compared with people who live in cooler areas. 

For our analysis, we also examined the relationship between temperature and prevalance of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease.  We found no statistical relationship.  For kidney disease, the correlation coefficient (r) was exactly .00 (no relationship). For diabetes it was -0.08, (essentially no relationship, or an extrmely weak negative correlation). For heart disease, it was -0.06 (essentially no relationship, or an extremely weak negative correlation).  

We also examined the relationship between chronic disease prevalance rates amongst Medicaid recipients and ZIP code-level temperature variation, in order to see if there was any relationship between prevalance and neighborhood temperature when controlling for poverty.  Here, again, we found a moderate correlation between a neighborhood's median afternoon temperature and the prevalance rate for asthma (r = .37, weak-moderate positive correlation), copd (r = .45, moderate positive correlation), and markers of heart disease -- congrestive artery disease (r = .58, moderate positive correlation), heart attack (r = .49, moderate positive correlation) -- and hypertension (r = .43, moderate positive correlation).   This allows us to say: poor people in the hottest neighborhoods have have higher rates of several conditions exacerbated by heat, compared with poor people in the coolest neighborhoods. 

This comparison helps exemplify the trend.  ZIP Code 21209, a leafy area in Northwest Baltimore, had the lowest median afternoon temperature in the urban heat island study, 93.1 degrees and the city's third lowest hypertension rate amongst Medicaid patients (8 percent). ZIP Code 21213, a concrete-heavy area of East Baltimore that includes parts of Broadway East and Oliver, had the city's 7th-highest median afternoon temperature (out of 27 studied ZIP Codes), 95.4 degrees and the 6th-highest hypertension rate amongst Medicaid recipients (16.8 percent).

In explaining the variance we see in disease rates -- both for the population at large and for poor people on Medicaid -- neighborhood-level markers of poverty are much more important predictors than markers of neighborhood temperature, though temperature does have explanatory power. 

For the population as a whole, the relationship between COPD prevalance and ZIP Code temperature (r = .72, r-squared = .52) and asthma prevalance and ZIP Code temperature (r = .87, r-squared = .77) was extremely strong. 

The correlation coefficient (r) for COPD was .61 (on a scale from -1, perfect negative correlation, to 1, perfect positive correlation), a moderately strong relationship. Asthma, had a moderate positive correlation coefficient of .50. Using the determination coefficient (r-squared), the value for COPD was .37, and the value for asthma was .25. 

This is somewhat complicated by the fact that there is also a relationship between temperature and poverty in Baltimore. Again, it's important to note that our analysis did not establish a causal relationship between neighborhood temperature and disease prevalance.

### EMS Analysis - Data and Methods

We obtained data from Baltimore City describing each EMS call in the city between January 1, 2014 and November 30, 2018, which included the ZIP Code of the call, the date and exact time of the call, the primary medical reason for the call and other factors.  We obtained hourly temperature and dew point data for the same period, captured by the National Weather Service monitoring station located in the Inner Harbor.  We merged the EMS data and temperature data sets to calculate the ambient temperature at the time of each call, adjusting the Inner Harbor values to account for Baltimore's urban heat island using the data described above. Using this adjusted temperature data and the Inner Harbor dew point values, we calculated the heat index at the time of each call in the data, and used that as the foundation for our analysis. 

Our goal was to determine whether calls for certain types of medical conditions are more prevalent in periods of extreme heat, when compared with periods of cooler temperatures.  To do this, we grouped each call into temperature buckets that align with the National Weather Service's heat index safety table. https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-index. The NWS heat index formula assumes conditions of light wind and shade, noting that exposure to full sun can increase heat index values by up to 15 degrees. We were unable to obtain the necessary data to calculate Wet Bulb Globe Temperature, which the NWS says can be a better measure of heat stress in full sunlight. 

The NWS heat index buckets are:
* < 80 = not unsafe temperatures
* Approximately 80-90 = caution
* Approximately 91-102 = extreme caution
* Approximately 103-124 = danger
* Approximately 124+ = extreme danger. 

In examining frequency of conditions in each temperature group, we had to account for the fact that some temperatures are much more common than others throughout the year.  In Baltmore, it's 75 degrees far more often than it is 110 degrees.  If we simply counted calls for each condition, the results would be very skewed.   

For each medical condition in each temperature grouping, we ended up calculating the number of hours, on average, between calls during the observed period.   

Take calls for heat exhaustion, which intuitively increase as temperatures rise.  Between January 2014 and November 2018, there were 112 hours when the heat index was above 103 degrees, the NWS danger zone.  During that same period, there were 35 heat exhaustion calls when the temperature was also above 103 degrees. That's one heat exhaustion call every 3.2 hours, on average, when the heat index is over 103 degrees.  

Now consider the times when the heat index was below 80 degrees, just below the NWS caution range.  Between January 2014 and November 2018, there were 35,286 hours when the temperature was below 80 degrees. During that same period, there were 39 calls for heat exhaustion when the temperature was below 80 degrees.  There were actually MORE total calls for heat exhaustion when it was below 80 degrees than when it was above 103 degrees.  But there was, on average, only one heat exhaustion call every two weeks (342 hours) when it was below 80 degrees.  

The numbers below reflect this calls per hour statistic. 

### EMS Analysis - Findings

We first examined EMS calls during the summer of 2018 (June 21 to September 20) to see how calls varied by temperature within a single season.  In the heat index danger zone, asthma calls happen at a rate of one every 2.4 hours, up from one every 3.2 hours when it's under 80 degrees. COPD shows a similar increase, from a call every 4.6 hours when it's under 80 degrees to a call every 3.3 hours when it's over 103 degrees. 

Behavioral/Psychiatric disorder calls are also more common, at a rate of one call per hour in the danger zone, compared with a call every 1.7 hours when it's under 80 degrees. Heat exhaustion/Heat stroke shows the biggest change, from one call every four days on average (102.2 hours) to one call every 2.5 hours.

#### Table 2 | Primary Impression Group | Ratio Condition Calls v Heat Index converted to SD | five NWS Buckets #####
# This takes the table above, and converts the values into standard deviation above and below mean. This makes it a) easier to compare across conditions and b) easier to intepret by humans (hopefully).  A value of 1 is one standard deviation above the mean.  A value of 2 is two standard deviations above the mean.  A value of -1 is one standard deviation below the mean.  So, when the value for heart attacks is 1 when it's in the heat index danger zone, and -1 when it's 70, that means heart attacks are more common, relatively speaking, when it's 110.

When examining, Temperature variations between different parts of the city do not appear to explain the variation in disease rates     


* The hottest parts of the city also have the highest rates of respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD.  This is not to say that heat is the most important driver of respiratory conditions or that we have established a strong causal relationship between heat and respiratory conditions. Heat does appear to have some direct influence, but statistically speaking, markers of poverty do a better job explaining the observed variations in disease rates than temperature in linear models. This finding is still meaningful, for the purpose of our reporting. As we've previously established, neighborhood-level heat and poverty are strongly linked in Baltimore.  And this finding allows us to report an unfortunate truth about Baltimore: it just so happens that in the neighborhoods that are the hottest, there are simply more people who have these debilitating chronic disease exacerbated by extreme heat. 
* When examining the poorest patients in the hospital system -- people on Medicaid -- we also see that the rates of asthma and COPD are higher in the hottest neighborhoods.  But so too are the rates of heart disease -- including heart attacks -- and diabetes.  Again, we have not established the importance of temperature causality.  We're simply saying that in the hottest neighborhoods, the poor people who live there are more likely to be afflicted by several chronic conditions affected by heat than the poor people who live in the coolest neighborhoods.
