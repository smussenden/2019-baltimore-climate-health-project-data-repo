# Baltimore Climate Project Heat and Health findings

#### Overall Findings

People with chronic medical conditions exacerbated by high temperatures will be particularly vulnerable as the planet warms, public health officials warn. These conditions include respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD, heart disease, diabetes and kidney disease. To understand how temperature increases will affect people in Baltimore, Capital News Service analyzed data describing inpatient hospital visits, emergency room visits, emergency medical (EMS) response calls, demographic information and ZIP-code level temperature variations measured in a landmark 2018 study of the urban heat island in the city. 

Our findings:

* The hottest parts of the city also have the highest rates of respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD.  This is not to say that heat is the most important driver of respiratory conditions or that we have established a strong causal relationship between heat and respiratory conditions. Heat does appear to have some direct influence, but statistically speaking, markers of poverty do a better job explaining the observed variations in disease rates than temperature in linear models. This finding is still meaningful, for the purpose of our reporting. As we've previously established, neighborhood-level heat and poverty are strongly linked in Baltimore.  And this finding allows us to report an unfortunate truth about Baltimore: it just so happens that in the neighborhoods that are the hottest, there are simply more people who have these debilitating chronic disease exacerbated by extreme heat. 
* When examining the poorest patients in the hospital system -- people on Medicaid -- we also see that the rates of asthma and COPD are higher in the hottest neighborhoods.  But so too are the rates of heart disease -- including heart attacks -- and diabetes.  Again, we have not established the importance of temperature causality.  We're simply saying that in the hottest neighborhoods, the poor people who live there are more likely to be afflicted by several chronic conditions affected by heat than the poor people who live in the coolest neighborhoods.

* Because there's such a strong relationship between neighborhood heat in Baltimore and markers of poverty,
