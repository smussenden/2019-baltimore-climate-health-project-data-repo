# Baltimore Climate Project Heat and Health findings

#### Overall Findings

People with chronic medical conditions exacerbated by high temperatures will be particularly vulnerable as the planet warms, public health officials warn. These chronic conditions exacerbated by extreme temperature include respiratory conditions like asthma and COPD; heart disease; diabetes; and kidney disease. 

To understand how temperature increases will affect people in Baltimore, Capital News Service analyzed data describing inpatient hospital visits, emergency room visits, emergency medical (EMS) response calls, demographic information and ZIP-code level temperature variations measured in a landmark 2018 study of the urban heat island in the city. 

Our topline findings:

* The hottest parts of Baltimore in the summer also have the highest rates of people with asthma and COPD. In Baltimore, it's an unfortunate twist of fate that there are more sick people in the hottest areas who have these two chronic diseases exacerbated by extreme heat, when compared with people who live in cooler areas. For the population at large, we did not observe a similar pattern with diabetes, kidney disease or heart disease.      

* Poor people in the hottest parts of Baltimore in the summer also have higher rates of asthma and COPD, when compared with poor people in the coolest parts.  Poor people in the hottest parts of the city also have higher rates of diabetes and heart disease, when compared with poor people in the coolest parts. 

* In explaining the variance we see in disease rates -- both for the population at large and for poor people on Medicaid -- neighborhood-level markers of poverty are much more important than markers of neighborhood temperature, though temperature does have explanatory power. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that there is also a relationship between temperature and poverty in Baltimore.  It's important to note that our analysis did not establish a causal relationship between neighborhood temperature and disease prevalance.

* Last summer in Baltimore (June 21 to September 20), emergency response calls increased for the following conditions when the heat index went above the National Weather Service's approximate cutoff for "dangerous" heat index conditions (~103 degrees), compared with calls during cooler temperatures during the summer: Asthma, behavioral/psychiatric disorders, cardiac arrest, COPD, dehydration, diabetic hypoglycemia, end stage renal disease, heat exhuastion, hypertension, hypotension, obvious death, fainting, drug/alcohol overdose/withdrawal. Common conditions of note that didn't increase when the temperature increased: Generic respiratory distress, diabetic hyperglycemia. 

* Examining the entire time period between January 1, 2014 and November 30, 2018, the following conditions increased when the heat index went above the National Weather Service's approxmiate cutoff for "dangerous" heat index conditions (~103 degrees), compared with cooler temperatures during the entire 4 year, 11 month period: Behavioral/psychiatric disorders, cardiac arrest, COPD, dehydration, diabetic hyperglycemia, diabetic hypoglycemia, dizziness, end stage renal disease, heat exhaustion, hypertension, hyperthermia, hypotension, obvious death and drug/alcohol overdose/withdrawal. Notably, asthma was slightly less common at 103+ than at cooler temperatures when we expanded this analysis. 


### Hospital Analysis - Data and Methods

We obtained data describing inpatient and emergency room admissions at Maryland hospitals from the Health Services Cost Review Commission for FY2014 to FY2019, which includes information about diagnoses for each visit by a patient, the patient's ZIP code, insurance payer, race and other information.  We obtained information on ZIP Code level temperature variation by processing data from a team of researchers who captured block-by-block temperature data in Baltimore on August 29. 2018 showing variation in the city's urban heat island. We obtained ZIP Code level demographic and economic information from the U.S. Census bureau's American Community Survey from 2017.  Using these three data sets -- and additional information from the CDC on disease prevalance for select conditions -- we were able to examine relationships between heat, demographics and health condition prevalance.  https://osf.io/e63x9/


### Hospital Data Analysis - Detailed Findings

Through our analysis, we found a general trend that showed the hottest ZIP Codes of Baltimore in the summer also have the highest rates of people with asthma and COPD. 

There was a significant positive correlation between the percentage of hospital visits by people between 2014 and 2019 from a given ZIP Code who were diagnosed with asthma or COPD and the ZIP Code's median afternoon temperature as measured by in the urban heat island study. The hotter the temperature, the higher the asthma and COPD diagnosis rate.

The correlation coefficient (r) for COPD was .61 (on a scale from -1, perfect negative correlation, to 1, perfect positive correlation), a moderately strong relationship. Asthma, had a moderate positive correlation coefficient of .50. Using the determination coefficient (r-squared), the value for COPD was .37, and the value for asthma was .25. 

This comparison helps exemplify the general trend.  ZIP Code 21209, a leafy area in Northwest Baltimore, had the lowest median afternoon temperature in the urban heat island study, 93.1 degrees and the city's third lowest asthma rate (8 percent). ZIP Code 21205, a concrete-heavy area of East Baltimore that includes parts of McElderry Park, had the city's fifth-highest median afternoon temperature, 95.74 degrees and the second highest asthma rate (16.8 percent).    

Here, it's important to note that we're not talking about causation.  We have not established evidence that heat caused the variations we observed.  But our analysis does allow us to say this: In Baltimore, it's an unfortunate twist of fate that there is a greater concentration of people in the hottest areas who have chronic respiratory diseases exacerbated by extreme heat, when compared with people who live in cooler areas.

For our analysis, we also examined the relationship between temperature and prevalance of diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease.  We found no statistical relationship for these conditions.  For kidney disease, the correlation coefficient (r) was exactly .00 (no relationship). For diabetes it was -0.08, (essentially no relationship, or an extrmely weak negative correlation). For heart disease, it was -0.06 (essentially no relationship, or an extremely weak negative correlation).  

We also examined the relationship between chronic disease prevalance rates amongst Medicaid recipients and ZIP code-level temperature variation, in order to see if there was any relationship between prevalance and neighborhood temperature when controlling for poverty.  

Here, again, we found a moderate correlation between a neighborhood's median afternoon temperature and the prevalance rate for asthma (r = .37, weak-moderate positive correlation), copd (r = .45, moderate positive correlation), and markers of heart disease -- congrestive artery disease (r = .58, moderate positive correlation), heart attack (r = .49, moderate positive correlation) -- and hypertension (r = .43, moderate positive correlation).   This allows us to say: poor people in the hottest neighborhoods have have higher rates of several conditions exacerbated by heat, compared with poor people in the coolest neighborhoods. 

This comparison helps exemplify the trend.  ZIP Code 21209, a leafy area in Northwest Baltimore, had the lowest median afternoon temperature in the urban heat island study, 93.1 degrees and the city's third lowest hypertension rate amongst Medicaid patients (8 percent). ZIP Code 21213, a concrete-heavy area of East Baltimore that includes parts of Broadway East and Oliver, had the city's 7th-highest median afternoon temperature (out of 27 studied ZIP Codes), 95.4 degrees, and the 6th-highest hypertension rate amongst Medicaid recipients (16.8 percent).    

In explaining the variance we see in disease rates -- both for the population at large and for poor people on Medicaid -- neighborhood-level markers of poverty are much more important predictors than markers of neighborhood temperature, though temperature does have explanatory power. 

For the population as a whole, the relationship between COPD prevalance and the poverty rate (r = .72, r-squared = .52) and asthma prevalance and the poverty rate (r = .87, r-squared = .77) was extremely strong. The same was true for the relationship between those conditions and median household income.

This is somewhat complicated by the fact that there is also a relationship between temperature and poverty in Baltimore. Again, it's important to note that our analysis did not establish a causal relationship between neighborhood temperature and disease prevalance.

### EMS Analysis - Data and Methods

We obtained data from Baltimore City describing each EMS call in the city between January 1, 2014 and November 30, 2018, which included the ZIP Code of the call, the date and exact time of the call, the primary medical reason for the call and other factors.  We obtained hourly temperature and dew point data for the same period, captured by the National Weather Service monitoring station located in the Inner Harbor.  We merged the EMS data and temperature data sets to calculate the ambient temperature at the time of each call, adjusting the Inner Harbor values to account for Baltimore's urban heat island using the data described above. Using this adjusted temperature data and the Inner Harbor dew point values, we calculated the heat index at the time of each call in the data, and used that as the foundation for our analysis. 

Our goal was to determine whether calls for certain types of medical conditions are more prevalent in periods of extreme heat, when compared with periods of cooler temperatures.  To do this, we grouped each call into temperature buckets that align with the National Weather Service's heat index safety table. https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat-index. The NWS heat index formula assumes conditions of light wind and shade, noting that exposure to full sun can increase heat index values by up to 15 degrees. We were unable to obtain the necessary data to calculate "Wet Bulb Globe Temperature"", which the NWS says can be a better measure of heat stress in full sunlight. 

The NWS heat index buckets are:
* < 80 = not unsafe temperatures
* Approximately 80-90 = caution
* Approximately 91-102 = extreme caution
* Approximately 103-124 = danger
* Approximately 124+ = extreme danger 

In examining frequency of conditions in each temperature group, we had to account for the fact that some temperatures are much more common than others throughout the year.  In Baltmore, it's 75 degrees far more often than it is 110 degrees.  If we simply counted calls for each condition in each temperature group, the results would be very skewed.   

For each medical condition in each temperature grouping, we ended up calculating the number of hours, on average, per call. Or, put another way, we determined the average number of hours between calls for each condition in a given temperature range during the observed period.   

Take calls for heat exhaustion, which we expected to see increase sharply as temperatures rise.  Between January 2014 and November 2018, there were 112 hours when the heat index was above 103 degrees, the NWS danger zone.  During that same period, there were 35 heat exhaustion calls when the temperature was also above 103 degrees. That's one heat exhaustion call for every 3.2 hours when the heat index is over 103 degrees.  

Now consider the times when the heat index was below 80 degrees, just below the NWS caution range.  Between January 2014 and November 2018, there were 35,286 hours when the temperature was below 80 degrees. During that same period, there were 39 calls for heat exhaustion when the temperature was below 80 degrees.  There were actually MORE total calls for heat exhaustion when it was below 80 degrees than when it was above 103 degrees.  But there was, on average, only one heat exhaustion call for every 342 hours (about two weeks) when it was below 80 degrees.  

The numbers below reflect this hours per call statistic. 

### EMS Analysis - Findings

We first examined EMS calls during the summer of 2018 (June 21 to September 20) to see how calls varied by temperature within a single season in a single year. Many conditions had calls occur at more frequent rate when the heat index spiked beyond 103 degrees, including: Asthma, behavioral/psychiatric disorders, cardiac arrest, COPD, dehydration, diabetic hypoglycemia, end stage renal disease, heat exhuastion, hypertension, hypotension, obvious death, fainting, drug/alcohol overdose/withdrawal. 

As expected, the most significant swings were in heat exhaustion/heat stroke, which swung from 102 hours per call when the heat index was under 80, to 2.65 hours per call when the heat index hit 103, a 39X difference. 

Dehydration also showed significant increase (under 80, 29.67 hours per call; over 103, 3.11 hours per call; 9.5x difference), as did end stage renal disease (under 80, 115 hours per call; over 103, 17.7 hours per call; 6.5x difference), a much less common condition in the EMS data.  

Drug withdrawal/overdoses, a very common call type, showed big swings, too (under 80, 1.9 hours per call; over 103, .79 hours per call; 2x difference), as did alcohol withdrawl/overdoses (under 80, 6.5 hours per call; over 103, 2.2 hours per call; 3x difference). Calls for hypertension were also much more common (under 80, 10 hours per call; over 103, 5.3 hours per call, nearly 2x difference). 

Other conditions also showed significant differences, if not as large as those listed above. The asthma call rate differed by 33 percent (under 80, 3.2 hours per call; over 103, 2.4 hours per call), and COPD differed by 39 percent (under 80, 4.6 hours per call; over 103, 3.3 hours per call).  Calls for psychiatric disorders jumped, too (under 80, 1.7 hours per call; over 103, 1 hour per call, 70 percent difference).

Other notables: 

* Diabetic hypoglycemia (under 80, 6.1 hours per call; over 103, 4.1 hours per call, 53 percent difference)
* Cardiac arrest (under 80, 4.53 hours per call; over 103, 3.5 hours per call; 29 percent difference)
* Hypotension (under 80, 15.9 hours per call; over 103, 10.6 hours per call; 50 percent difference)
* Obvious death (under 80, 10.8 hours per call; over 103, 6.6 hours per call; 63 percent differnce)

Not every condition affected by heat saw the call rate increase as heat index values hit the danger zone. 

Calls for "respiratory distress" were slighly less common in very hot weather (under 80, 2.9 hours per call; over 103, 3.5 hours per call; 21 percent difference).  General "chest pain/discomfort" showed a slight decrease in hot weather (under 80, 1.4 hours per call; over 103, 1.5 hours per call; 7 percent difference), as did diabetic hyperglycemia (under 80, 6.1 hours per call; over 103, 6.6 hours per call, 8 percent difference).

We also examined performed the same analysis using the entire time period between January 1, 2014 and November 30, 2018, instead of just isolating calls for last summer. The main effect of widening the pool of calls was to greatly increase the number of calls in the under 80 bucket, and incorporate winter calls.  

The observed patterns described above were largely the same. 

Again, the most significant swings were in heat exhaustion/heat stroke, which swung from 342 hours per call when the heat index was under 80, to 3.2 hours per call when the heat index hit 103, a 107X difference. 

Dehydration also showed significant increases (under 80, 46.3 hours per call; over 103, 4.48 hours per call; 10.3x difference), as did end stage renal disease (under 80, 171 hours per call; over 103, 28 hours per call; 6.1x difference), a much less common condition in the EMS data.  

Drug withdrawal/overdoses, a very common call type, showed big swings, too (under 80, 3.2 hours per call; over 103, 1.2 hours per call; 2.7x difference), as did alcohol withdrawl/overdoses (under 80, 7.5 hours per call; over 103, 2.9 hours per call; 2.5x difference). So did hypotension (under 80, 22.4 hours per call; over 103, 11.2 hours per call; 2x difference).

Other conditions also showed significant differences, if not as large as those listed above. Calls for hypertension were more common (under 80, 11.7 hours per call; over 103, 8 hours per call; 46 percent difference). So were diabetic hyperglycemia (under 80, 7.7 hours per call; over 103, 5.6 hours per call; 37 percent difference), hypotension (under 80, 15.9 hours per call; over 103, 10.6 hours per call; 50 percent difference), and "obvious death" (under 80, 12.9 hours per call; over 103, 8 hours per call; 62 percent difference).
 
Notable differences from this analysis and the summer 2018 analysis: 

* Asthma is actually slightly more common under 80 degrees than over 103 (under 80, 2.56 hours per call; over 103, 2.8 hours per call; 9 percent difference)
* Cardiac arrest (under 80, 4.76 hours per call; over 103, 4.48 hours per call; 6 percent difference).  This is down from the 29 percent difference when we just examined summer 2018, likely because of the increase in cardiac events in very cold weather.
* COPD (under 80, 5.1 hours per call; over 103, 4.4 hours per call; 14 percent difference). This is down from the 39 percent when we just examined summer 2018, likely because of the effect of very cold weather on respiratory conditions.
* Diabetic hypoglycemia	(under 80, 5.48 hours per call; over 103, 5.09 hours per call; 7 percent difference). This is down from 53 percent when we just examined summer 2018. 


### Additional health data analysis in process

* EMS data - I have calculated similar statistics for two of our target East Baltimore ZIP Codes, 21213 and 21205.  So far, it appears largely in line with our city-wide analysis, though calls for certain conditions seem to spike in the hottest weather at rates higher than the city.  Need to confirm these findings.
* EMS data - I am still working out the kinks on methodology to calculate how to use the rate of calls to determine how many extra calls for targeted conditions we could expect to see as the number of very hot days increases in the future because of climate change. 
* I have run the numbers on CDC prevalance-rates of select chronic conditions by U.S. Census tract, and will be using them to benchmark and extend the hospital analysis. I need to write it up. 
* I need to pull statistics on the age breakdown of people in our target neighborhoods, with an eye to how many elderly people and kids live in those areas.
